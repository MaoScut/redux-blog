没有indexRoute？

what do you want to achieve in this project?
Home page:
	list all article title as links and its brief content
Detail page:
	show content for a certain article
	this page's url should include article id
first finish basic function, and than polish your singe page application.

so let's start
19:33 delete all thing unrelative

finish component fetch data from store, but when change something in Home.jsx, the app doesn't update?

oh on, i am trapped into react hmr once again, although i have solved it, i didn't find all the reason, one of them is that i should not use variable in hot.accapt(), directly use string.

finish click title=>change url which contains article id=>show detail component!
